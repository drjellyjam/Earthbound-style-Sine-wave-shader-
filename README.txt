An earthbound style 2D FRAGMENT sine wave shader.

I couldint find a simple and good one online so i just made one. Took all day to get perfect.

I made it in gamemaker so you can use it there without changing anything. But if you want to use it anywhere else you might need to change things.
Im not a shader person :p
